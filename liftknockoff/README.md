# Lift Knockoff (i.e. oober) lab README.md

### 1. Assignment basically completed! There are a few issues: 1) is that the info window only pops up in 2 places; one for "me" and one for the last marker created in the loop.

### 2. Collaborated w/ Wei-ren Murray and Mikayla Toffer, help from TA Juliana

### 3. About 7 or 8 hours? Didn't really track
