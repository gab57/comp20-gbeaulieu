# comp20-gbeaulieu

## What is this purpose of this Git repository? 
This is a repository featuring various projects from Comp20 (Web Programming)

## What was your favorite lab or assignment and why?
My favorite project of the semester was assignment 2 (Lyft knockoff) because it combined elements of front-end design (which I enjoy) as well as interaction with a server (which was fun to learn about and understand). I particularly liked this assignment because it's lead me to understand Uber and Lyft better, and now whenever I use these ride hailing platforms, I imagine how the app is working beneath the UI.

## How much do you think you have grown from day 1 of this course to now?
I've grown a considerable amount since day 1, particularly in my ability to figure things out independently with the help of the internet and stack overflow. At the same time, I've also learned to appreciate group work and group discussions (working with other people or TAs is more fun and often more productive).

## What was the most important thing that you learned in this course? Cite two examples as evidence.
Using the terminal more effectively was the most important thing I learned by far! I'd had some previous experience cd-ing and ls-ing and mkdir-ing and a bit of curl request experience, but from this class I've learned to both better understand what is happening when using the terminal and enjoy using it to be more efficient. Examples of this include: handling committing and pushing to GitHub via the terminal, using it to startup and test the server/database from assingment 3, and testing for security breaches in assignment 4.

## Now that you have finished the course, what topic would you like to delve deeper into?
I think cyber security is a quite interesting topic that we only touched on briefly, so I'd like to potentially take more security courses (or at least read more on the subject) in the future when I have some time.
